## Description
This is a simple AngularJS demo that demonstrates a few of the nifty angular modules and directives I used in a past project.  For simplicity, it currently uses mock data and locations (i.e. the town of Egham may or may not be in the North weather zone).  The original intent was to replace a legacy Excel spreadsheet with a web-based dashboard that could give quick visibility of realtime data all on one page, with various options.

## Usage and Documentation
Coming soon
